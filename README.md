# QueryVlcb
Some Python scripts to query for information on a VLCB/CBUS layout and perform
some actions that are not provided by the [Module Management Console](https://github.com/david284/MMC-SERVER) (MMC).

The scripts connect to a running CBUS Server on network port 5550 on the localhost.
Such a server can be provided by MMC, JMRI CBUS Hub or Nigel Phillip's CBUS Server.

## Scripts

QueryNodes.py
: Queries for nodes that are online on a VLCB/CBUS network. 
This script does not take any command line parameters.

: Sends a QNN message and collects the PNN responses from the nodes and presents them
in a human-readable form.

QueryNodeParameters.py
: Queries a node for its parameters and presents these parameters in a human readable
form.
This script takes an optional command line parameter that is the node number of
the node to be queried. 

CountCANCABs.py
: Sends a parameter query to node number 65535, which is dedicated to CANCAB,
and counts the received responses.
This assumes that each connected CANCAB responds to this parameter query.

CanActivity.py
: Shows CAN message counts and other info that indicates activity on the CAN bus.

CanErrors.py
: Shows errors on the CAN bus for each VLCB node.

CanBufferHighWatermark.py
: Queries all nodes and for each VLCB node query the CAN Service
high watermark diagnostic. 
This is useful to identify potential CAN problems.

: This was created as an early test and is now incorporated into CanActivity.py.

NodeActivity.py
: Shows counters that show activity for each VLCB node such as counts of
produced and consumed events.

NodeErrors.py
: Shows some error counters for each VLCB node.

ManufacturerReset.py
: Resets a node to manufacturer settings.

## Supporting files
The scripts above makes use of the following files:

CanMessage.py
: A class that represents a CAN frame and its information.

CbusServerConnection.py
: Makes a connection to a CBUS Server on network port 5550 on the localhost.
Provides functions for sending and receiving CAN messages on this port.

GridConnect.py
: Converts `canmessage` to and from a GridConnect format that can be used when
communicating with the CBUS server.

CbusInfo.py
: Interprets CBUS numbers into something human-readable.

vlcbdefs.py
: Contains VLCB/CBUS constants. 
Copied from https://github.com/SvenRosvall/VLCB-defs

vlcbdictionaries.py
: Contains dictionaries for looking up human-readable text for VLCB/CBUS numbers.

generateVlcbLookup.sh
: Generates `vlbdictionaries.py` from https://github.com/SvenRosvall/VLCB-defs
